/* Sorting Exercise 3: Sorted Merge 
You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the

 */

/* 
 * Test case 1:
 * A: [1,4,7,9]
 * B: [2,6,9,10]
 * 
 * Test case 2:
 * A: [1,4,7,9]
 * B: [2,6,8,9,10,15,16]
 * 
 * Method:
 * 
 * choose whichever array is longer -> we will add elements to this longArray
 * compare, add, and shift
